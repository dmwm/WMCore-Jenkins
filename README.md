This respository contains Jenkinsfiles that configure Jenkins Pipelines used to run tests for the [dmwm/WMCore](https://github.com/dmwm/WMCore) project.

## Repository Structure

* `WMCore-Aggregate-Baseline`: Contains the Jenkinsfile to aggregate the baseline unittest results
* `WMCore-PR-pylint`: Contains the Jenkinsfile to run pylint tests for a PR
* `WMCore-PR-Report`: Contains the Jenkins file to run tests suites triggered by a PR
  * Triggers`WMCore-PR-pylint` and `WMCore-PR-test`
* `WMCore-PR-test`: Contains the Jenkinsfile to run unit tests for a PR

    * `setup-env.sh`: Copies and modifies the necessary files, creates necessary directories in the Jenkins $WORKSPACE
    * `run_local.sh`: Sets environment variables when wanting to test locally
* `WMCore-unittests-baseline`: Contains the Jenksinfile to run baseline unittests
* `docker/wmcore`: The custom test image in which tests are ran in
    * Contains the necessary scripts and dependencies to run unittests and linting
    * Currently, the custom test image is located in the CMS Registry

## Developer Image
* Need source env_unittest.sh (TODO: Check exactly which variables)
* Need X509_HOST/USER_CERT/KEY set
* PYTHONPATH properly set
